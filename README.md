# HDB-Resale-Prices-Analysis-1991-2023

This was a group project analysing the driving factors of HDB Resale Prices in Singapore, particularly the effect of public infrastructure. This was published in an online website at https://is428-proj.streamlit.app/

I was reponsible for sourcing the resale price dataset, data cleaning, EDA, dashboard design and formatting, along with the visual design of the website but not the code. I also vetted the predictive model. Other members sourced the other datasets and coded most of the predictive model or the website. The report was equally distributed.

Included are the Tableau Dashboards, datasets used and predictive model.

Due to the large size of the datasets and files, the following files were not uplaoded
- (facilities added) 1990-2000 Resale Price of Flats.csv
- (facilities added) 2000-2012 Resale Price of Flats.csv
- (facilities added) 2012-2014 Resale Price of Flats.csv
- (facilities added) 2017-2023 Resale Price of Flats.csv

This file was uploaded as a preview of the dataset due to its small size. All resale price data has this format but with many more rows of transactions.
